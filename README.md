# ChainFL Documentaion
Chainfl is a simple federated learning framework based on blockchain(Etherenum Network). In this framework, the blockchain acts as a FL training manager to record training message and supervise the entire network. Specifically, some algorithms are implemented in Solidity for a better promotion on the research of blockchain empowered federated learning.

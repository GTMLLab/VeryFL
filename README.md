## Introduction
VeryFL is a simple federated learning framework embedded with blockchain (Etherenum). Federated Learning side uses PyTorch while blockchain-side use Solidity deployed on Ethereum to implement on-chain mechanism.
The main propose of VeryFL is to provide the blockchain-based FL algorithm with a real execution environment. However you can use VeryFL for:
 
 - Understanding basic workflow of the federated learning.
 - Verifying centralized federated learning algorithm.  
 - Verifying blockchain-based federated learning algorithm running on real Ethereum environment.

## Dependence

Ethereum Environment 
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)

Node.js >= 16.0.0 and npm >= 7.10.0
- Ganache
```
npm install ganache --global
```
Python Environment
- Anaconda 

1. Python: 3.6 ~ 3.9

2. PyTorch: 1.13
- Brownie
```
pip install eth-brownie
```
## Basic Function 
### Execute federated learning experiment.
VeryFL can simulate the federated learning experiment with both centralized/de-centralized paradigm. VeryFL contains many image classification datasets and classic federated learning algorithms.

### On-chain Mechanism implemented with Solidity.
One of the main propose of VeryFL is to provide experiment environment for blockchain-based federated learning. With the embedded Ethereum network, on-chain mechanism can be implemented in Solidity and can be deployed in VeryFL.

### Model copyright protection and transaction .
By inject watermark into model through model watermarking technology, VeryFL implement a demo framework which can protect model copyright and execute model transaction by managing watermark on the blockchain.(Detail of this function can refer to our article below [2])

## Code Structure and Usage

### Quick Start
```
python test.py --benchmark FashionMNIST
```

```
#test.py
import argparse
from task import Task
import config.benchmark

if __name__=="__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--benchmark', type=str, default="FashionMNIST", help="Running Benchmark(See ./config/benchmark.py)")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    benchmark = config.benchmark.get_benchmark(args.benchmark)
    global_args, train_args, algorithm = benchmark.get_args()
    classification_task = Task(global_args=global_args, train_args=train_args, algorithm=algorithm)
    classification_task.run()

```


### Customize Task Parameter
In ./config/benchmark.py, each Benchmark contains three parts
1. global_args: global FL parameters like client number, dataset, model.
2. train_args: training parameters like learning rate, weight decay.
3. Algorithm: federated learning algorithm (Aggregator, Client, Trainer)

### Add New FL Algorithm
1. Client side algoritm need to implement Trainer (./client/trainer) 
2. Server side algorithm need to implement aggregator (./server/aggregation_alg)

### Add New On-chain Mechanism
1. Implement algorim with Solidity (./chainEnv/contracts)
2. Deploy smart contract when network start (./chainfl/interact)
3. Wrap the function call with Brownie SDK in class chainProxy (./chainfl/interact)
4. Interact with blockchain when training through chainProxy.
